## Requirements

1. A working Rust toolchain for compilation.
2. Node.js v20 or newer.
3. [libmpv](#libmpv)

### libmpv

In order to run the application, you will need a copy of `mpv.dll` and `mpv.lib` (Rename `mpv.dll.a` to `mpv.lib`, because the GNU toolchain is a bit funky on Windows.)

If you have one of the following CPUs, download the latest `libmpv/mpv-dev-x86_64-v3-[date]-git-xxx.7z`:

Intel: Haswell or newer with AVX2 (September 2013 - Present)
or Atom "Gracemont" or newer (Nov 2021 - Present)

AMD: "Excavator" or any Ryzen CPU (c. June 2015 - Present)

If you do not have one of the above CPUs, download the latest `libmpv/mpv-dev-x86_64-[date]-git-xxx.7z`
